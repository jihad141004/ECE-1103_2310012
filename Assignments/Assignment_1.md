## Assignment Name : Create a simple banking system in C using a switch statement to manage these menu options
1.Deposit: Ask for an amount and add it to the balance.

2.Withdraw: Ask for an amount and deduct it if funds are sufficient; otherwise, show an
error.

3.Balance Inquiry: Display the current balance.

4.Exit: End the program.

Validate inputs to prevent negative deposits or withdrawals and handle insufficient funds.

In this assignment we created a  Banking Menu system where users can choose different options according to their needs. We also handled incorrect inputs to prevent errors.

## Assignment Name :
Guess the Secret Number with Limited Attempts
Create a number guessing game where the program selects a random secret number
between 1 and 50. The user has to guess the number, and they get unlimited attempts until
they guess correctly. However, if they exceed 10 attempts, the game stops, and a message
indicates that theyâ€™ve run out of attempts.
Use a while loop to keep asking the user for guesses, and use break when:
1.The user guesses correctly.
2.The attempt limit (10 guesses) is reached.

    int choice, count = 0;
    while(1){
        printf("Enter a number between (1-50):  ");
        scanf("%d", &choice);
        if(choice==secret_num){
            printf("\nCongratulation You Guessed Correctly! \n");
            return;
        }
        if(choice>secret_num && count<9 ){
            printf("Guess smaller\n");
        }else if(choice<secret_num && count<9 ){
            printf("Guess Bigger\n");

In this assignment, we developed a program in which the computer randomly generates a number, and the objective is for the user to guess that number. If the user successfully guesses the number within 10 attempts or fewer, a winning message is displayed; otherwise, a losing message is shown.
