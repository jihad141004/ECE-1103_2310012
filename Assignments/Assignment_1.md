## Assignment Name :
Create a simple banking system in C using a switch statement to manage these menu options
1.Deposit: Ask for an amount and add it to the balance.

2.Withdraw: Ask for an amount and deduct it if funds are sufficient; otherwise, show an
error.

3.Balance Inquiry: Display the current balance.

4.Exit: End the program.

Validate inputs to prevent negative deposits or withdrawals and handle insufficient funds.

## **Code :**

#include <stdio.h>
void display()
{
  printf("\n------Banking System MENU -------\n");
  printf("   1 : Deposit\n ");
  printf("   2 : Withdraw\n ");
  printf("   3 : Balance Inquiry\n ");
  printf("   4 : Exit\n\n ");
}

void solve()
{
  double balance = 0.0, amount;
  int choice;

  while (1)
  {
    display();
    printf("Enter you choice: ");
    scanf("%d", &choice);
    if (choice == 4)
    {
      break;
    }
    else
    {
      switch (choice)
      {
      case 1:

        printf("Enter amount to deposit: ");
        scanf("%lf", &amount);
        if (amount < 0)
        {
          printf("\nEnter valid amount\n");
        }
        else
        {
          balance += amount;
        }
        break;
      case 2:
        printf("Enter amount to Withdraw: ");
        scanf("%lf", &amount);
        if (amount > balance || amount < 0)
        {
          printf("\nEnter valid amount\n");
        }
        else
        {
          balance -= amount;
        }
        break;
      case 3:
        printf("Your current Balance :  %.2lf\n", balance);
        break;

In this assignment, we developed a banking menu system that allows users to select various options based on their needs. Additionally, we implemented input validation to handle incorrect entries, ensuring a smooth and error-free user experience.</div>

## Assignment Name :
Guess the Secret Number with Limited Attempts
Create a number guessing game where the program selects a random secret number
between 1 and 50. The user has to guess the number, and they get unlimited attempts until
they guess correctly. However, if they exceed 10 attempts, the game stops, and a message
indicates that theyâ€™ve run out of attempts.
Use a while loop to keep asking the user for guesses, and use break when:
1.The user guesses correctly.
2.The attempt limit (10 guesses) is reached.

## **Code :**
~~~
#include<stdio.h>
#include<stdlib.h>
#include<time.h>

void solve(){
    srand(time(NULL));
    int secret_num = (rand()%49)+1;
    int choice, count = 0;
    while(1){
        printf("Enter a number between (1-50):  ");
        scanf("%d", &choice);
        if(choice==secret_num){
            printf("\nCongratulation You Guessed Correctly! \n");
            return;
        }
        if(choice>secret_num && count<9 ){
            printf("Guess smaller\n");
        }else if(choice<secret_num && count<9 ){
            printf("Guess Bigger\n");
        }
        count++;
        if(count==10){
            break;
        }
    }
    printf("\nSorry You lost !\n");
}
int main(){
    solve();
}

In this assignment we created a program where computer randomly generates a number and we had to guess that number. If we successfully guess the number in less than or equal top 10 guesses then we will get winning message or else we will get losing message.
